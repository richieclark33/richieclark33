### Hi there ðŸ‘‹

I grew up in NW Iowa in a small town of about 5000.  While there was less to do than a large city, it gave me the opportunity to try and do a lot of different things.  Because of that, generally I enjoy conversations about most things - just not seafood.

I have 3 kids - girl (7ish), boy (5ish), girl (2-ish).  I've learned a lot and who I am more because of them.  I love spending time with them and seeing them grow.  I am married and have been with my wife since high school.

I was fortunate to start programming at a company I loved working for right out of college in 2010.  They helped shape some opinions and helped make clear where my best skills are and where I fall short.

### User manual

_Here are some ways to help me work with you better_

### Preferred Working Style
- I work 100% remotely and enjoy that flexibility.
- I've switched into a person who does their most focused work in the morning and am a bit more freeflow in the afternoon.
- It's important for me to have "off" times where I don't feel on call all the time.  As if I don't, I'm always tense about responding right away and get worn out.
- I am not a meeting person.  Generally most meetings fall into the bullet list or email category for me, however I do find meetings valuable for discussion on ideas and for setting expectations as slack or email can lose tone and context.  Also, if it's something important or serious to say I always prefer talking 1 on 1 vs trying some other medium.  All that said, I am a person who would rather meet than have miscommunication or have a missing tone so something gets misconstrued. 
- For ideas I generally need time to process them.  Sometimes a good sleep or a couple days to let my brain process it comes to a better solution than giving a first opinion.
- I've always had the mentality of "Fail Fast" so I generally prefer to quick iterate and keep progressing on it or scrap it for something else

### What motivates me
- **Innovation and new things (whether technology or just new ideas)**  I have always loved new technology and learning.  If my brain isn't getting pushed then I tend to be bored and looking for something else to engage in
- **Making others day-to-day better and/or more efficient** My favorite projects have been ones that directly improve colleagues day to day and make it a better day for them.
- **Larger initiatives** Tied to the first one, it takes a lot of thought, organization, and new ideas to build larger scale things
- **Great UI and high quality design** I was fortunate to start my career with a company that had strong designers and since I've seen what great design looks like, I continue to try and make functional, well thought through, and good looking things.  Generally of all things in the coding process, the look of it is what drives me the most. (Which is often why just backend work doesn't interest me)
- **Being creative**

### What demotivates me
- **Long debates** - I hold very little strong opinions when it comes to code design and usually want to be in the conversation and then come to a conclusion and move on.  That's not to mean I don't understand or care, but I just don't want to discuss something over and over again
- **Wrong expectations** - There are always times that unexpected things comes up, but poor planning, poor communication feels like it causes large waste of time when the same things just keep changing because expectations were set wrong initially.  I have a hard time not feeling like every issue is a fire and so poor communication makes me contineously be in a "I need to fix that immediately" when that may not be the case.  Clarifying priority is helpful.
- **Zero feedback**  This is a bit of a double edge as frank conversation can be difficult if I haven't built the relationship as I can easily take it as an attack on me, but a person or people who aren't willing to have a two way conversation makes the product as a whole worse.  Let me come up with an idea and then let's have a conversation on what's good and bad to keep improving it or scrap it for another try.

### Some known flaws
- I often don't show work early because the tendency is to then get feedback about half baked things and I get frustrated because "it's not done yet".  
- I prefer almost everything to refactoring.  Something that works I tend to :shrug: and move on to something else.  I rarely go through and make sweeping changes unless it's a known initiative or it's my first time on a codebase.  This stems a bit on my belief that unless it's performance based, it's opinion based and I don't hold strong.
- I have opinions, but tend to keep them to myself when not in a lead role. "Too many cooks in the kitchen".  If you really want to know my opinions have a 1 on 1 with me as I'm generally pretty honest.  
- People who don't give grace in development are hard to work with for me.  I get anxious with buggy code and so I work very hard to not release bugs. However, when people aren't willing to understand sometimes things break in tech I have little patience for.

### Working environment
I've worked in a lot of different situations and ways of doing things so don't hold strongly to "I must work in a ___ style".  I prefer more freedom and less hand holding.  When I say I'm going to do something, it's very rare I don't.  I prefer setting "what needs to be done" and then letting me do it.  I often find daily "what am I doing" to end up false by the end of the day because of the nature of how devs days go.  I'll do it if required, just find it a little :shrug:.  Much prefer to set a weekly routine and then let me do it.
